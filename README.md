# My Personal Project

## Strategy Game
A game that revolves around a villain powering up while defending against waves
of heroes. The game is made for people interested in playing strategy games related
to building up power from scratch, similar to popular games such as *Super Auto Pets* or *Slay the Spire*.
The project serves as a quick introduction to game development for me and will give me insight on
whether I intend to pursue game development/ similar projects.

## **User Stories:**
